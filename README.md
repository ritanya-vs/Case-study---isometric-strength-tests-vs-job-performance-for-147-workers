# üí™ Strength and Job Performance Analysis  

## üìä Project Overview  
This project leverages **R programming** to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and investigate the relationship between isometric strength tests and job performance. The analysis is based on data from 147 workers and aims to understand how various strength metrics correlate with job performance. Key statistical techniques like **mean**, **median**, **correlation**, **regression**, and **ANOVA** are used to gain insights that can inform workforce management decisions.

## üîç Key Objectives  
- **Investigate the relationship** between isometric strength tests (e.g., grip strength, leg strength) and job performance.  
- **Identify statistical trends** in strength metrics and their impact on worker productivity.  
- Provide **insights for workforce management**, helping organizations optimize hiring and training processes based on strength and performance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Analysis Techniques  

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and ensuring the dataset is in the proper format for analysis.  
   - **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculating central tendency measures (mean, median) to summarize data distribution.

### 2. **Correlation Analysis**  
   - Analyzing the correlation between different strength metrics and job performance to identify any significant relationships.

### 3. **Regression Analysis**  
   - Fitting regression models to predict job performance based on strength metrics and to quantify the strength of relationships.

### 4. **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**  
   - Testing if there are statistically significant differences in job performance across different groups based on isometric strength test results.
